# Hilfe

CLI tool to automate tasks in projects.

### Install
```
yarn global add hilfe
npm install -g hilfe
```

### Example 
```
hilfe add-license
```


### Included recipes
add-license
add-prettier
add-travis
add-coveralls

### Add new recipes
The goal is to make it easy to add and create custom recipes, both public ones
that can be published on NPM and used by others and privet ones that may be
used only in a single project to automate common tasks. Currently this is not
possible however. If you are interessted in discussing usage or how it should
work, please open an issue.
